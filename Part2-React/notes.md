Thanks for the assignment,

I used my own boilerplate to set up the application. I have configured the boiler plate to build both Development and Production environments.

I used webpack to bundle the application.
Bootstrap for styling the layout.

I used firebase to save the data when user clicks on submit button.

Assumption:

Any room that is checked should have a selected state, whose presentation is identical to the 'Room 1' field, and it's corresponding Adults/Children drop-down fields should be enabled.

I assumed that selecting the one of the rooms should reflect the values on the room 1, but I'm not sure if multiple rooms are selected which room to reflect on room1.

I made it to reflect the latest room selected on Room.

I have tried my best to complete the assignment as per my understanding meeting all the use cases, please let me know if you find any bugs or ways to improve the code.

I have focused more on functionality than on UI
